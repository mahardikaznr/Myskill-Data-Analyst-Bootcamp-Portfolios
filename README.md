# Myskill Data Analysis Bootcamp Journey! 🚀

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub directory where I embarked on an exciting data exploration adventure! 🌟 In this repository, I have utilized PostgreSQL to dive deep into 4 dynamic datasets and tackle 5 intriguing Business Questions Exercises. 📈💼

## Contents

The directory includes the following files:
- `Final_Code.sql`: The main SQL script containing the data analysis queries.
- `order_detail.txt`: TXT file containing order details.
- `sku_detail.txt`: TXT file containing SKU details.
- `customer_detail.txt`: TXT file containing customer details.
- `payment_detail.txt`: TXT file containing payment details.
- `Exercises SQL.pdf`: Detailed cases for the SQL exercises.

## Business Questions

During this immersive journey, I focused on answering vital business questions, such as:

1. Identifying the month with the highest total transaction value (after_discount) in 2021.
2. Revealing the category that generated the highest transaction value in 2022.
3. Comparing categories with increased and decreased transaction values from 2021 to 2022.
4. Unraveling the top 5 most popular payment methods during the year 2022.
5. Sorting the following 5 products based on their transaction values:

## Data Analysis Process

1. Explore the datasets: `order_detail`, `sku_detail`, `customer_detail`, and `payment_detail`.
2. Craft SQL queries to extract valuable insights.
3. Analyze the data and obtain meaningful results.
4. Plan to visualize the findings using PowerBI for enhanced understanding and presentation.

## How to Use?

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install PostgreSQL and create a new database.
3. Load the CSV files into their respective tables in the database.
4. Execute the SQL queries in `Final_Code.sql` to explore the data and get valuable insights.
